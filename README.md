Classification of Soil using CNN and OpenMP
This repository contains a soil classification project implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenMP. The project focuses on using machine learning techniques to classify soil samples based on their visual characteristics.

The project is implemented using the following technologies and tools:

Python: The main programming language used for coding the project.
CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): CNN models are constructed and trained using popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
OpenMP: An API that allows parallel processing on shared-memory architectures, used to optimize computations in the project.
Image processing libraries: Python libraries like OpenCV or PIL are employed for image preprocessing tasks.
NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, used for numerical operations on arrays and matrices.
